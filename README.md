​## Overview
​
### Challenge-1​

Users should be able to:
​
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See an exact resemblance to the original code

## My process
​
### Built with
​
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Mark down documents
​
### What I learned
​
I learned that there are many ways to create a website and as a coder we should be able to see if there are ways that are more efficient to make the code cleaner while still keeping the original design properly functioning
​
### Continued development
​
Through my time taking this bootcamp there are sure to be new techniques that I can implement to further clean up the code and apply that to future projects/ jobs
