## Overview
​
### The challenge
​
Users should be able to:
​
- look at existing code and find ways to improve the code without changing the overall design
- be familiar with HTML and CSS to find patterns and redundancies that can be streamlined

​
## My process
​
### Built with
​
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
​
### What I learned
​
This project allowed me to utilize my knowledge and abilities to debug code and also to clean up ​sections of the code so later myself or others will have an easier time understanding what is happening within the code.

### Continued development
​
I would like to continuing to refine my understanding of everything covered in this projects but the understanding of classes and ids stand out a lot especially with later lessons.
​
### Useful resources
​
- (https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/html/html-cheatsheet) - This helped out a lot for understanding alternatives to using the very generic div tag
- (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - This site contained a lot of resources and tutorials that helped answer most of my questions
